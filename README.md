# Hi! I'm eternalxlks ðŸ‘‹
I am just a starter, who is still trying to figure out how to fully use GitHub to it's full extent................
So far, I have made a few things:
[My Website!](https://eternalxlks.github.io)&nbsp;&nbsp;
[My Shop! (It actually doesn't work)](https://eternalxlks.github.io/EternalShop/)&nbsp;&nbsp;
[Web Pong!](https://eternalxlks.github.io/WebPong/)&nbsp;&nbsp;
[Bomb Dodgers!(use WASD to move)](https://eternalxlks.github.io/BombDodgers/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/god/GOAT (haha)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Dragon Ball guy. 
- #### Contributing:
- you can contribute and I honetly don't care if you fork my repositories.

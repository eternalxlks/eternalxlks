I am just a starter, who is still trying to figure out how to fully use GitHub to it's full extent................ 
So far, I have made a few things:
[My Website!](https://eternalxlks.github.io)&nbsp;&nbsp;
[My Shop! (It actually doesn't work)](https://eternalxlks.github.io/EternalShop/)&nbsp;&nbsp;
[Web Pong!](https://eternalxlks.github.io/WebPong/)&nbsp;&nbsp;
[Bomb Dodgers!(use WASD to move)](https://eternalxlks.github.io/BombDodgers/)
### Note this:
I really would like for someone to fork my repositories and help me with any bugs/malfunctions! 🙏 
### Tips
I would appreciate tips for my repositories and how to get better! 🥺
### Stuff:
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/god/GOAT (haha)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Dragon Ball guy.

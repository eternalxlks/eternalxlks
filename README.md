I am just a starter, who is still trying to figure out how to use GitHub to it's full extent................ 
So far, I have made a few things that took some time:
1. [My Website](https://eternalxlks.github.io)
2. [My Shop!](https://eternalxlks.github.io/EternalShop/)
3. [My Shop's profile (please follow!)](https://github.com/The-EternalShop)
4. [Web Pong!](https://eternalxlks.github.io/WebPong/)
5. [Bomb Dodgers! (use WASD to move)](https://eternalxlks.github.io/BombDodgers/)
6. [My GitHub Account! (please follow!)](https://github.com/eternalxlks)
### Note this:
I really would like for someone to fork my repositories and help me with any bugs/malfunctions! 🙏 
### Tips
I would appreciate tips for my repositories and how to get better! 🥺

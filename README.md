### Note this:
I really would like for someone to fork my repositories and help me with any bugs/malfunctions! 🙏 
### Tips
I would appreciate tips for my repositories and how to get better! 🥺
### Stuff:
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/god/GOAT (haha)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Dragon Ball guy.
- 🧠 And if for some reason, you ever want to see your exact location, use this! [Location Finder!(Latitude and Longitude only!)](https://eternalxlks.github.io/FindYourLocation/)
- 🍿 If your bored, you could always fidget with 2D-Minecraft! And when you fill out the space, just reload and you start fresh! (It's actally very bugged but works on Mobile) [The Game](https://eternalxlks.github.io/2D-Minecraft/)
